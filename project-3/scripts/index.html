       We are the hollow men <br>
       We are the stuffed men<br>
       Leaning together<br>
       Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br>
       Our dried voices, when<br>
       We whisper together<br>
       Are quiet and meaningless<br>
       As wind in dry grass<br>
       Or rats' feet over broken glass<br>
       In our dry cellar<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Shape without form, shade without colour, <br>
       Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br>
     </p>
      <p> Those who have crossed<br>
       With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom<br>
       Remember us-if at all-not as lost<br>
       Violent souls, but only<br>
       As the hollow men<br>
       The stuffed men.<br>
     </p>


                                <h3> II </h3>
   <p>Eyes I dare not meet in dreams<br>
       In death's dream kingdom<br>
       These do not appear:<br>
       There, the eyes are<br>
       Sunlight on a broken column<br>
       There, is a tree swinging<br>
       And voices are<br>
       In the wind's singing<br>
       More distant and more solemn<br>
       Than a fading star.<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Let me be no nearer <br>
       In death's dream kingdom<br>
       Let me also wear<br>
       Such deliberate disguises<br>
       Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves<br>
       In a field<br>
       Behaving as the wind behaves<br>
       No nearer-<br>
     </p>
      <p> Not that final meeting<br>
       In the twilight kingdom<br>
   </p>

                <h3>      III </h3>

      <p> This is the dead land<br>
       This is cactus land<br>
       Here the stone images<br>
       Are raised, here they receive<br>
       The supplication of a dead man's hand<br>
       Under the twinkle of a fading star.<br>
     </p>
      <p> Is it like this<br>
       In death's other kingdom<br>
       Waking alone<br>
       At the hour when we are<br>
       Trembling with tenderness<br>
       Lips that would kiss<br>
       Form prayers to broken stone.<br>
   </p>

                  <h3>      IV </h3>

      <p> The eyes are not here<br>
       There are no eyes here<br>
       In this valley of dying stars<br>
       In this hollow valley<br>
       This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms<br>
     </p>
       <p>In this last of meeting places<br>
       We grope together<br>
       And avoid speech<br>
       Gathered on this beach of the tumid river<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Sightless, unless<br>
       The eyes reappear<br>
       As the perpetual star<br>
       Multifoliate rose<br>
       Of death's twilight kingdom<br>
       The hope only<br>
       Of empty men.<br>
   </p>

                          <h3>    V </h3>

       <p>Here we go round the prickly pear<br>
       Prickly pear prickly pear<br>
       Here we go round the prickly pear<br>
       At five o'clock in the morning.<br>
     </p>
      <p> Between the idea<br>
       And the reality<br>
       Between the motion<br>
       And the act<br>
       Falls the Shadow<br>
      For Thine is the Kingdom<br>
    </p>
       <p>Between the conception<br>
       And the creation<br>
       Between the emotion<br>
       And the response<br>
       Falls the Shadow<br>
              Life is very long<br>
       </p>
       <p>Between the desire<br>
       And the spasm<br>
       Between the potency<br>
       And the existence<br>
       Between the essence<br>
       And the descent<br>
       Falls the Shadow<br>
              For Thine is the Kingdom<br>
       </p>
      <p> For Thine is<br>
       Life is<br>
       For Thine is the<br>
     </p>
      <p> This is the way the world ends<br>
       This is the way the world ends<br>
       This is the way the world ends<br>
       Not with a bang but a whimper.<br>
