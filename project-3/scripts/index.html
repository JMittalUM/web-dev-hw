       We are the hollow men <br>
       We are the stuffed men<br>
       Leaning together<br>
       Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br>
       Our dried voices, when<br>
       We whisper together<br>
       Are quiet and meaningless<br>
       As wind in dry grass<br>
       Or rats' feet over broken glass<br>
       In our dry cellar<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Shape without form, shade without colour, <br>
       Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br>
     </p>
      <p> Those who have crossed<br>
       With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom<br>
       Remember us-if at all-not as lost<br>
       Violent souls, but only<br>
       As the hollow men<br>
       The stuffed men.<br>
     </p>


                                <h3> II </h3>
   <p>Eyes I dare not meet in dreams<br>
       In death's dream kingdom<br>
       These do not appear:<br>
       There, the eyes are<br>
       Sunlight on a broken column<br>
       There, is a tree swinging<br>
       And voices are<br>
       In the wind's singing<br>
       More distant and more solemn<br>
       Than a fading star.<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Let me be no nearer <br>
       In death's dream kingdom<br>
       Let me also wear<br>
       Such deliberate disguises<br>
       Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves<br>
       In a field<br>
       Behaving as the wind behaves<br>
       No nearer-<br>
     </p>
      <p> Not that final meeting<br>
       In the twilight kingdom<br>
   </p>

                <h3>      III </h3>

      <p> This is the dead land<br>
       This is cactus land<br>
       Here the stone images<br>
       Are raised, here they receive<br>
       The supplication of a dead man's hand<br>
       Under the twinkle of a fading star.<br>
     </p>
      <p> Is it like this<br>
       In death's other kingdom<br>
       Waking alone<br>
       At the hour when we are<br>
       Trembling with tenderness<br>
       Lips that would kiss<br>
       Form prayers to broken stone.<br>
   </p>

                  <h3>      IV </h3>

      <p> The eyes are not here<br>
       There are no eyes here<br>
       In this valley of dying stars<br>
       In this hollow valley<br>
       This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms<br>
     </p>
       <p>In this last of meeting places<br>
       We grope together<br>
       And avoid speech<br>
       Gathered on this beach of the tumid river<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Sightless, unless<br>
       The eyes reappear<br>
       As the perpetual star<br>
       Multifoliate rose<br>
       Of death's twilight kingdom<br>
       The hope only<br>
       Of empty men.<br>
   </p>

                          <h3>    V </h3>

       <p>Here we go round the prickly pear<br>
       Prickly pear prickly pear<br>
       Here we go round the prickly pear<br>
       At five o'clock in the morning.<br>
     </p>
      <p> Between the idea<br>
       And the reality<br>
       Between the motion<br>
       And the act<br>
       Falls the Shadow<br>
      For Thine is the Kingdom<br>
    </p>
       <p>Between the conception<br>
       And the creation<br>
       Between the emotion<br>
       And the response<br>
       Falls the Shadow<br>
              Life is very long<br>
       </p>
       <p>Between the desire<br>
       And the spasm<br>
       Between the potency<br>
       And the existence<br>
       Between the essence<br>
       And the descent<br>
       Falls the Shadow<br>
              For Thine is the Kingdom<br>
       </p>
      <p> For Thine is<br>
       Life is<br>
       For Thine is the<br>
     </p>
      <p> This is the way the world ends<br>
       This is the way the world ends<br>
       This is the way the world ends<br>
       Not with a bang but a whimper.<br>

           Though The Hollow Men is more stark and elegant than Eliot's complex poem, The Wasteland, one could still end up spending hours if you were to dissect this poem line by line.
Whether one agrees with Eliot's sentiments and his personal philosophy or not, his imagery is simply superb.
