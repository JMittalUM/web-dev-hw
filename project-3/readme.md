## HomeWork Project Three
**learning about CSS**

- this week we learned about:


1. style
2. css
3. color


- It is getting hard to keep track all the coding! But I do think im starting to get the hang of it. I just need to work on keeping everything organized and clean.
- I have been keep a notebook full of reminders and coding examples.
- I also really need to work on the style of my pages, they just do not look that clean and professional in my opinion, but that does take time.


-  I am still having issues with:


1. figuring out how to do color blocks

**Project Three, The Literature SHowcase.**
- For this project I would like to do it on the poem *The Hollow Men* by T.S. ELiot.
- I have always liked this poem so it will be nice to create a page for it! However, I only plan on doing a section of the poem, being that it is extremely long!
- For the color palette I was thinking of either doing greys, white, black to go with the seriousnessof the poem. And then have one interesting color in it like violet. Below are some images I am interested in using and an example of the section of the poem I would like to be using.

Style Plan
The grey tones I used.
For images I went with ones that were on the darker side to possbily compliment the lighter tones of the background.

**Project Three Part 2
- I truly struggled with getting links to other pages to work, iamges to work, blocks, and fonts
- I mainly had problems with getting the fonts to work and it still is not how I would like it to be, but after spending 3 hours on just trying to figure out how to use fonts in the main text and it not working, I gave up.
- I am now having issues publishing my live site, it now will go to my readme page and I do not know if I will be able to get this figured out.
- Over all this was a very very frustrating assignment and I wish that I started 3 days ago instead of 2. I feel that if I had gave myself that extra time it would have been less stressful.
- After reading the help section I still have not found guidence on why I am having such issues with my fonts and why I am unable to publish/see my live site.
