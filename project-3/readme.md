## Project 3
**learning about CSS**

- this week we learned about:


1. style
2. css
3. color


- It is getting hard to keep track all the coding! But I do think im starting to get the hang of it. I just need to work on keeping everything organized and clean.
- I have been keep a notebook full of reminders and coding examples.
- I also really need to work on the style of my pages, they just do not look that clean and professional in my opinion, but that does take time.


-  I am still having issues with:


1. figuring out how to do color blocks

**Project 3, The Literature SHowcase.**
- For this project I would like to do it on the poem *The Hollow Men* by T.S. ELiot.
- I have always liked this poem so it will be nice to create a page for it! However, I only plan on doing a section of the poem, being that it is extremely long!
- For the color palette I was thinking of either doing greys, white, black to go with the seriousnessof the poem. And then have one interesting color in it like violet. Below are some images I am interested in using and an example of the section of the poem I would like to be using.
