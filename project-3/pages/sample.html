      <h2> I-III</h2>
        <h3> I </h3>
       We are the hollow men <br>
       We are the stuffed men<br>
       Leaning together<br>
       Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br>
       Our dried voices, when<br>
       We whisper together<br>
       Are quiet and meaningless<br>
       As wind in dry grass<br>
       Or rats' feet over broken glass<br>
       In our dry cellar<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Shape without form, shade without colour, <br>
       Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br>
     </p>
      <p> Those who have crossed<br>
       With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom<br>
       Remember us-if at all-not as lost<br>
       Violent souls, but only<br>
       As the hollow men<br>
       The stuffed men.<br>
     </p>


                                <h3> II </h3>
   <p>Eyes I dare not meet in dreams<br>
       In death's dream kingdom<br>
       These do not appear:<br>
       There, the eyes are<br>
       Sunlight on a broken column<br>
       There, is a tree swinging<br>
       And voices are<br>
       In the wind's singing<br>
       More distant and more solemn<br>
       Than a fading star.<br>
     </p>
    <p>   Let me be no nearer <br>
       In death's dream kingdom<br>
       Let me also wear<br>
       Such deliberate disguises<br>
       Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves<br>
       In a field<br>
       Behaving as the wind behaves<br>
       No nearer-<br>
     </p>
      <p> Not that final meeting<br>
       In the twilight kingdom<br>
   </p>

                <h3>      III </h3>

      <p> This is the dead land<br>
       This is cactus land<br>
       Here the stone images<br>
       Are raised, here they receive<br>
       The supplication of a dead man's hand<br>
       Under the twinkle of a fading star.<br>
     </p>
      <p> Is it like this<br>
       In death's other kingdom<br>
       Waking alone<br>
       At the hour when we are<br>
       Trembling with tenderness<br>
       Lips that would kiss<br>
       Form prayers to broken stone.<br>
     </p>

         Though The Hollow Men is more stark and elegant than Eliot's complex poem, The Wasteland, one could still end up spending hours if you were to dissect this poem line by line.
Whether one agrees with Eliot's sentiments and his personal philosophy or not, his imagery is simply superb.
