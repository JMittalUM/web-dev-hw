<p>Thomas Stearns Eliot was a British essayist, publisher, playwright, literary and social critic, and one of the twentieth century's major poets. He moved from his native United States to England in 1914 at the age of 25, settling, working, and marrying there.For a poet of his stature, Eliot produced a relatively small number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, <q>My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.</q></p>
<p>In 1925, he collected <i>The Waste Land</i> and the poems in <i>Prufrock and Poems</i> into one volume and added The Hollow Men to form Poems: 1909–1925. From then on, he updated this work as <i>Collected Poems.</i>
