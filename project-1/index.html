      <h3> Lyrics</h3>
      <p> I just wanted<br>
  To reslove it<br>
   To make peace with<br>
   All those weekends <br>
 </p>
 <p> We all just give up<br>
   We all just stand down<br>
   With no lesson learned<br>
   With our eyes half shut<br>
 </p>
 <p> No confusion<br>
   It's been obvious<br>
   Hallelujah<br>
   I've been saved by no one again, and again<br>
 </p>
 <p> But we all just give up<br>
   We all stand down<br>
   With no lesson learned<br>
   With our eyes half shut<br>
 </p>
