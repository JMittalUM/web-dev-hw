# My First README.md
## Jessica Mittal-Lohse
**Thoughts about this assignment:**
- I was a little confused about the assignment at first.
- I orginally thought it was going to be *very difficult* to accomplish anything, but it wasn't too bad.
- I've already learned a lot and we are only a few days in. Such as:

1. How to name files
2. Not to use strange characters and spacing
3. However I'm `still not sure what code or code block is`

Learning the Markdowns is going to take a while.

I was having a hard time linking the screenshot but I finally figured it out! Still have a lot to learn.

**Making My Live Site:**

- Honestly there were many times that I had to go back pretty far to figure out a simple mistake I made. I haven't ran into any major problems yet so I am happy about that. The one thing that was an issue for the Live Site assignment was making sure it would bring up the correct webpage! Due to me not saving and clicking fetch origin my README page would show up as my webpage. It took me a while to figure out the issue but I was able to resolve it on my own.

- I realized that most of the problems that I faced were due to not:


1. Saving
2. Checking changes and making a commit
3. Clicking fetch origin

Man there are so many steps!


**Conclusion:**

Over all I did enjoy making the Live Site after everything was figured out. I actually felt pretty proud of what I was able to accomplish! I'm starting to get the hang of this coding thing but, I definitely need to come up a system so I don't forget any steps. I also found looking at how other students are going about the assingments helps a lot. I am excited to learn more and see how creative this can get.

**Experience with Wayback Machine:**

- I wasn't too excited about the Wayback Machine. I looked up Target and viewed it from 2000 in June. There was more content to the page than I thought. But also there was a lot of broken links throughout the page. It is strange to think how complex webpages have become... I visited a few other pages such as FreePeople and my favorite artists website.
- The FreePeople website back in 2000 was almost nothing but a few sentences. And while inspecting the artist page for [Kit King](https://www.kitkingart.com/) the coding kept changing/moving while I watched it.
