# My First README.md

**Thoughts about this assignment:**
- I first thought that it was going to be *very difficult* to accomplish anything
- But I discovered that its not too hard when we have step by step instructions


1.  I started feeling overwhelmed with what we are asked to do but after starting I am less intimated.
2. However the way the homework is set up is a little confusing still, I hope to have this resolved by the end of this project.
3. I am actually starting to feel excited about this class and can't wait to see what else we learn.
