    <h2><i><b>Lets Get Started</b></i></h2>
      <h3><i> Materials:</i></h3>
      <ul>
      <li> Plaster gauze <i>(also known as plaster cloth)</i></li>
      <li> Water</li>
      <li> Petroleum jelly</li>
      <li> Bucket </li>
      <li> Tarp <i>(or something to work over thats easy to clean)</i></ul>

    <h3><i>Directions:</i></h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Fill the bucket about a 1/3 full, it will be around 2<sup> 1/2</sup> cups</li>
      <li> Lay down the tarp or what ever you choose to use</li>
      <li> Cut up <b><i> a lot</i></b> strips of the gauze. Lengths should vary and be around 3"x1" and 2"x1" </li>
      <li> Generously cover hand in petroleum jelly</li>
      <li> Throughly wet the plaster gauze strips in water and start layering on front side of the hand. You will want to create a clean seam </li>
      <!-- insert image here-->
      <li>Put on about 3 to 4 layers of the gauze on the front side</li>
      <li>Wait for it to dry, it will get warm and then cool <i>( you will feel this on the outside of the cast)</li>
      <li> Repeat 5-7 on the back side of the hand. Make sure to leave an edge between the two sides. <b> DO NOT</b> overlap onto the front sides layers</li>
        <!--insert image-->
      <li> After both sides of dry its time to take the cast off. Have the owner of the hand gently move their fingers to loosen up the cast. then gently pull one side of the cast off the hand. This may take some time</li>
      <li> After getting the hand out of the cast put the two pieces together and layer some more gauze on the outside seam. Leave top open to pour what you choose to make the mold out of.</li> </ol>

    <h5> And there you have it you have made a cast of a hand!</h5>
