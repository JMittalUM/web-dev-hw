    <h2><i><b>Let's Get Started</b></i></h2>
      <h3><i> Materials:</i></h3>
      <ul>
      <li> Plaster gauze <i>(also known as plaster cloth)</i></li>
      <li> Water</li>
      <li> Petroleum jelly</li>
      <li> Bucket </li>
      <li> Tarp <i>(or something to work over that's easy to clean)</i></li></ul>

    <h3><i>Directions:</i></h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Fill the bucket about a 1/3 full, it will be around 2<sup> 1/2</sup> cups</li>
      <li> Lay down the tarp or whatever you choose to use</li>
      <li> Cut up <b><i> a lot</i></b> of strips of the gauze. Lengths should vary and be around 3"x1" and 2"x1" </li>
      <li> Generously cover hand in petroleum jelly</li>
      <li> Thoroughly wet the plaster gauze strips in water and start layering on the front side of the hand. You will want to create a clean seam </li>
      <p>

      <li>Put on about 3 to 4 layers of the gauze on the front side</li>
      <li>Wait for it to dry, it will get warm and then cool <i>( you will feel this on the outside of the cast)</i></li>
      <li> Repeat 5-7 on the back side of the hand. Make sure to leave an edge between the two sides. <b> DO NOT</b> overlap onto the front sides layers</li>
        <!--possibly insert image-->
      <li> After both sides of dry its time to take the cast off. Have the owner of the hand gently move their fingers to loosen up the cast, then gently pull one side of the cast off the hand. This may take some time</li>
      <li> After getting the hand out of the cast put the two pieces together and layer some more gauze on the outside seam. Leave top open to pour what you choose to make the mold out of</li> </ol>

    <h4> There you have it you have made a cast of a hand!</h4>
    <p> And here's a url to a video of someone casting a hand. I do not recommend making the plaster strips this long, due to the fact that it causes it to <ins>lack detail.</ins>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARNvWYjAfsY)</p>
