    <p class="card-description" id="reason-i-choice-mold-making-description">
      The reason I decided the topic of mold making is because it something that I have been doing lately. This semester I am in the Sculpture 2 class. Our first project was to make a sculpture that responds to the theme of moment in time. For this project I decided to mold and cast the hands of people that have impacted my life. I felt that mold making was good topic for this project because it was something that I know well and also has a good amount of steps. Mold making is a semi-delicate process and if done incorrectly won't turn out, or at the very least be very very flawed. I feel that making a mold is a fun and intesting thing to know.

    <h2 class="card-label">Mold Making to Casting:</h2>
    <p class="card-description" id="mold-making-and-casting-description">
        I find the casting part a little more fun than mold making. With the casting, there are many things that you can use; wax,metal,plaster,concrete, etc. I particularlly like using wax. Casting could be said to be the easiest part but also the most frustrating. When casting many things can go wrong such as, bubbles in the casted material, not filling the mold fully or evenly, and even breakage.
