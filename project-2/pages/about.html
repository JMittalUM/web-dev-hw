My name is Jessica Mittal and I'm from Lewistown, Montana. I am 21 years old. I am a junior at the University of Montana and am pursing a Bachelors of Art. Later on I may try to get a Masters of Fine Art. I never drink coffee and I love learning about myths, magic, and supernatural things.

      Presently I am a art student at the University of Montana, I do not have a focus in the arts. I enjoy making 3D work, drawing, panting, and photography which is almost everything! I don't have a solid idea of what I am going to do with an art degree, but I am happy I am getting a degree in something I love. I possibly will use it to work in the art department in movies, be a professor if I get a MFA, work for a magazine, or maybe be a creative director, who knows!?
