My name is Jessica Mittal and I'm from Lewistown, Montana. I am 21 years old. I am a junior at the University of Montana and am pursing a Bachelors of Art.
Later on I may try to get a Masters of Fine Art. I never drink coffee and I love learning about myths, magic, and supernatural things. I love music also, my taste is always changing and I have a new favorite song each week. Right now it's Knife and Yet Again by Grizzly Bear.

    <p class="card-description" id="my-present-and-future-description">
      Presently I am a art student at the University of Montana, I do not have a focus in the arts. I enjoy making 3D work, drawing, panting, and photography which is almost everything!
      I don't have a solid idea of what I am going to do with an art degree, but I am happy I am getting a degree in something I love. I possibly will use it to work in the art department in movies, be a professor if I get a MFA, work for a magazine, or maybe be a creative director, who knows!?

    <p class="card-description" id="my-hometown-description">
My hometown Lewistown is a very small town in the middle of Montana. The town is known for its pure water and the chokecherries. In my opinion there is not much to do in Lewistown but many people like the town. IT takes about 15 mins. to bike from one side of town to the other, which can be a nice thing. The town is beautiful though, it has many streams and a river running through it. The golden hour is especially beautiful in Lewistown, just the way it hits the clocktower is breathtaking.
